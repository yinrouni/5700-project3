The benchmarks tp help deciding the “best” TCP variant would be the following:
1)	Throughput: Ratio of total data transferred to the time taken to transfer.
2)	Latency: Roundtrip time for a packet
3)	Packet Drops: Number of packet loss during transmission

Add a CBR source at N2 and a sink at N3, then add a single TCP stream from N1 to a sink at N4. Analyze the throughput,
packet drop rate, and latency of the TCP stream as a function of the bandwidth used by the CBR flow.
Start the CBR at a rate of 1Mbps and end with 10Mbps with increment of 1MB.
Then, start TCP stream and record the data between TCP starts and TCP stream becomes
steady, including the throughput, latency and packet drop rate(y axis)
compare to CBR flow rate(x axis). Do the test multiple times and get the average to minimize the random error.

Exp3:

First, start the TCP flow. Once the TCP flow is steady, start the CBR source and analyze how the TCP and CBR flows
change under the following queuing algorithms: DropTail and RED. And to compare the performance of Reno and SACK.
The topology is same from experiment 1 and having TCP flow from N1 to N4 and CBR flow from
N5 to N6.

The CBR flow rate is not relevant, thus set it to a
constant rate(e.g. 5Mbps). Plot throughput, latency and packet
drop rate vs. time(s) graphics and compare Reno(DropTail), Reno(RED), SACK(DropTail),
SACK(RED), CBR(DropTail), CBR(RED) in this experiment.
